## to do ##
1. you need print the cfgs for chown and see what doesn't fit here - done
2. you need to print the path you got - done
3. you need to do the same for the other option of chown - done
    strchrnul is giving me the keyError that it is not in sys -> I need to go to llvmanalyses
        -> just needed to change it into __strchrnul
    basically the same problem with getdelim happened
    found the path in chownv too.
4. do the comparison - done
    but the difference was not found

get the edit-distance
